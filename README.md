# react-material-timeline

`react-material-timeline` is a vertical (right now!) timeline component which can be summarized with a simple equation:
```
react-material-timeline = react + material-ui + the code
```
If you are looking for elegant, simple library to show time based event, this is the perfect candidate!

## Features
* easy to integrate with `material-ui` and compatible with material theme
* lightweight and simple
* optional Typescript mappings

## Demo

## Instalation
### Prerequisites

## Usage

const events = [
